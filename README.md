# ansible-tuned

This Ansible playbook manages the installation, configuration, and activation of the tuned service.

Tuned is a dynamic adaptive system tuning tool used in Linux environments to optimize performance by adjusting various system settings dynamically. It provides pre-defined profiles that target specific use cases, such as high throughput, low latency, and energy saving, and automatically applies these configurations based on system activity.

For high traffic servers, using Tuned is particularly beneficial as it can enhance network throughput and responsiveness by adjusting parameters like CPU frequency scaling, I/O scheduling, and network stack settings. This optimization results in improved server performance, reduced latency, and better handling of high loads, ultimately leading to a more efficient and reliable infrastructure for handling significant network traffic.

This Ansible playbook ensures that:
- The tuned package is installed and configured correctly based on the OS family,
- Updates the tuned-main.conf file, manages the tuned service state, and activates the specified tuned profile if it is not already active.
